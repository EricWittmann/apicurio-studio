I have a quick announcement that I'm happy to make.  Until today, if you wanted to try out
the API Design Studio, you had to download the quickstart from the [Download page](http://www.apidesigner.org/download/).
Well no longer!

As of today, every release of the project will also deploy the quickstart for that release
to an openshift instance.  You can find it here:

* [https://release-apistudio.rhcloud.com](https://release-apistudio.rhcloud.com)

This way you can try out (or *use*) the latest released API Design Studio version without
downloading a thing!  As always, you'll need to log in with your GitHub credentials if
you want to use the tool.  Sure is easier than downloading something! (especially for you
savages that don't have a JVM installed...)

Happy Designing!
