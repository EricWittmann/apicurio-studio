Details
===
It's only been a week since the first release of the Studio, but we've spent
some time testing and finding bugs to squash.  This was all intended to make
it possible to release 0.0.2 as the first Tech Preview.  Hopefully we've got
something that folks can have a look at and evaluate.  If you like where we
are going with it (or if you don't), let us know!
