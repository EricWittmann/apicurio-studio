Guess what, everyone?  We've released [_Tech Preview 4_](https://github.com/apiman/apiman-studio/releases/tag/v0.0.5) 
(version 0.0.5) of the API Design Studio! 

This release represents the last (most likely) release in the Tech Preview
series of releases.  From now on we'll be entering into Beta territory!  The
reason for this is that we feel the Designer has enough functionality to be
useful.

So from now on, expect *Beta* releases!

Details
===
Exactly one month since our first Tech Preview release, we have our *final* 
Tech Preview release.

Have a [look at the roadmap](http://www.apidesigner.org/roadmap/) we've created 
on the project site.  There you will see details about what we've already done,
and what we have planned for the future.  Note that future plans may change or
at least re-prioritize.  You can always check back from time to time if you're 
interested, as we will keep the roadmap updated as we evolve the project.

More information about this latest release can be found here:

* [Studio Release v0.0.5](https://github.com/apiman/apiman-studio/releases/tag/v0.0.5)

Or if you're looking for a quick "Getting Started" experience, you can go
to the project website's [Download Page](http://www.apidesigner.org/download/).

Another way to track our progress is to have a look at the GitHub "project" for
the Beta release.  We use that project to track work we're doing and schedule
future work.  If it's not listed there, we're likely not yet working on it!

Happy Designing!
